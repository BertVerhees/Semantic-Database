 * Structure Types
 * 4.1.
 * Overview
 * The types described in this section are basic data structures assumed to be standardly available in implementation technologies.
 * The following types consititute the minimum set of structure types assumed by openEHR of an implementation environment.The following UML diagram illustrates the base.foundation_types.structures package.
 * As with the primitive types, inheritance and abstract classes are used for convenience of the definitions in openEHR models, but are not assumed to exist in exactly the same way within implementation technologies.
 * Hence, in an implementation, various workarounds or equivalences may be needed to obtain the defined semantics.
