 * Functional Meta-types
 * 8.1.
 * Overview
 * A small number of meta-types are defined that correspond to functional programming primitives, otherwise known as 'closures', 'lambda expressions' and so on.
 * These concepts are supported in most modern programming languages now, and the types defined here are intended to provide a minimal formal basis to enable other openEHR specification to defined function-related elements.
 * Since UML does not contain native functional elements, the semantics here are approximated using normal class facilities.The following illustrates the functional package.Two key abstractions are required, namely 'function as a type', and 'tuple', which enables arguments to be formalised.
 * To provide a 'function' type, a 'routine' type is also required.
 * For completeness, a 'procedure' type is also defined.
 * The 'tuple' type is defined as a generic meta-type whose descendants may additionally define any number of generic parameter types, corresponding to a type list.
